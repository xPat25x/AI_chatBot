## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Python 3.8+
- An OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key and other settings

6. Start the backend server:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Quick Start

Just run:
```
./start
```

This single command will:
1. Start the backend server on port 8000
2. Start the frontend development server on port 3000
3. Automatically connect the two services

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Using the Application

### General Chat

1. Select the "General Chat" tab
2. Choose a purpose from the dropdown menu
3. Type your message and press Enter or click the send button

### Creating and Using Custom Models

1. Select the "Custom Models" tab
2. Click "Create" to create a new model
3. Fill in the details:
   - Name: A descriptive name for your model
   - Description: What the model does
   - Model Type: GPT (text generation) or Assistant (file search & retrieval)
   - Instructions: Detailed instructions for how the model should behave
   - Website URL (optional): URL to extract content from
4. Once created, select your model from the dropdown
5. For Assistant-type models, you can upload files for the model to use
6. For any model, you can add website content by clicking "Add Website"
7. Start chatting with your custom model!

## Website Integration

When you add a website URL to your custom model, the application:

1. Extracts content from the specified URL
2. Processes the text to remove unnecessary elements
3. Adds the content to your model's knowledge base
4. Makes this content available for the model to reference during conversations

This is particularly useful for:
- Creating models that can answer questions about your website
- Building customer support bots that understand your product documentation
- Developing specialized assistants that leverage your web content
